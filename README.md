IDfy Fraud Busters
Round 2- Case Study Challenge Submission
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is an automated system designed to detect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in various types of documents, such as PDFs, Word files, and text documents. By using advanced machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the system can accurately identify sensitive data like names, addresses, and social security numbers. The goal is to help organizations ensure data privacy and comply with regulations like GDPR and CCPA. 
The system is user-friendly, featuring a simple drag-and-drop interface that provides real-time feedback on detected PII. Itâ€™s built to handle large volumes of documents, making it scalable for organizations with significant data processing needs. Powered by Python, with document parsing tools and a PostgreSQL database, the system is deployed on Google Cloud Platform to ensure high availability and performance. 
Future plans include improving detection accuracy with more advanced NLP models and expanding support for additional document formats and languages.
